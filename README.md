Please make sure that the image paths (`/imgs/yanni.jpeg`, `/imgs/research_interest1.jpg`, `/imgs/research_interest2.jpg`) are correctly set according to the actual location of your images within the GitHub repository. If the images are in the root directory, you can simply use the filename without the path.

To add the research interest images, you can create a folder named `imgs` in your repository and place the images there, then reference them as shown above. If you have the images and want to upload them to GitHub, you can do so by committing them to the repository.

If you need further assistance with GitHub or have any other questions, feel free to ask!
